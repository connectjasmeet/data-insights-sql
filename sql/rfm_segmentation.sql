-- RFM Segmentation Query
-- 
-- This query performs Recency-Frequency-Monetary (RFM) analysis on customer sales data.
-- It calculates:
--   - Recency: Days since the customer's last purchase
--   - Frequency: Number of orders placed
--   - Monetary: Total amount spent
-- It assigns scores (1â€“3) for each dimension and classifies customers into segments:
--   - Top Customer
--   - Loyal Customer
--   - At Risk
